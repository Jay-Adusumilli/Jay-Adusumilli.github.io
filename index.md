### Hello! 
My name is Jay Adusumilli and I'm a junior computer engineering student at Clemson University.

I am certified in Python, Microsoft Office and Solidworks. I also am proficient in C, C++, C# and Matlab. In addition to programming, I love working with my hands designing and building projects. In my free time I play for and help manage the Clemson esports club as the Community Head.
